      Life lately
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I became a mom on Halloween in 2023, and then returned to work 3 months later to find myself completely changed. In May, I resigned to focus entirely on our baby.</p>

<p>My career over the past 11 years has made me so proud. A girl from the hills of West Virginia grows into an exceptional engineer at Twitter. It terrifies me to loose that.</p>

<p>It also terrifies me to miss out on the moments where I can take our 12 month old to the park at 3pm, fall leaves crunching beneath our feet, and become completely absorbed by his smile as I push him on the swing.</p>

<p>In my career and life, I have found power in choosing the difficult path. I refuse to believe my only choice at having a fulfilling career, is returning to a 40+ hour work week.</p>

<p>I’m not sure where I’m going yet. I have some ideas. All of it is mildly terrifying.</p>

<p>A couple of days ago, it dawned on me to start a blog. I’ve always wanted one - but feared opening myself up to judgement of others. As of May, I would still sweat a little whenever I open a pull request.</p>

<p>Being a stay-at-home-mom, has exposed me to the ultimate judgement. So what’s a few random thoughts on the internet going to hurt?</p>

<p>As a woman in tech, I have struggled with extreme imposter syndrome - never sure what I’m saying is true, always assuming someone else knows more. I think the act of putting my knowledge down on a page would help tremendously.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
