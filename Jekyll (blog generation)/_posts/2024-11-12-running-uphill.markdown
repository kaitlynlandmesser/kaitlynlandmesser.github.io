I think it is one of my greatest strengths. This past September I ran the Park’s Half Marathon, and there’s part of the trail called “The Shredder” - basically a steep incline at mile 11. I noticed when it came, I picked up my pace and leaned into the challenge - leaving everyone else behind me. I think I do this a lot in life, and it’s core to who I am.
