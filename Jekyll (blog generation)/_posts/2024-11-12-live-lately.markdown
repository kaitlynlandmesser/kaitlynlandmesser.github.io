I became a mom on Halloween in 2023, and then returned to work 3 months later to find myself completely changed. In May, I resigned to focus entirely on our baby.

My career over the past 11 years has made me so proud. A girl from the hills of West Virginia grows into an exceptional engineer at Twitter. It terrifies me to loose that.

It also terrifies me to miss out on the moments where I can take our 12 month old to the park at 3pm, fall leaves crunching beneath our feet, and become completely absorbed by his smile as I push him on the swing. 

In my career and life, I have found power in choosing the difficult path. I refuse to believe my only choice at having a fulfilling career, is returning to a 40+ hour work week.

I’m not sure where I’m going yet. I have some ideas. All of it is mildly terrifying. 

A couple of days ago, it dawned on me to start a blog. I’ve always wanted one - but feared opening myself up to judgement of others. As of May, I would still sweat a little whenever I open a pull request. 

Being a stay-at-home-mom, has exposed me to the ultimate judgement. So what’s a few random thoughts on the internet going to hurt? 

As a woman in tech, I have struggled with extreme imposter syndrome - never sure what I’m saying is true, always assuming someone else knows more. I think the act of putting my knowledge down on a page would help tremendously. 

Stay tuned.
