              <p>This was my senior design project and seriously the most fun I've ever had programming. The <a href="https://github.com/WVU-Mobile/WVU-Mobile-iOS">code</a> (also <a href="https://github.com/WVU-Mobile/WVU-Mobile-iOS9"> here </a> too because I didn't know how to use git yet) is not great - I know - but I was learning! I'm currently rewriting it, optimizing it for Swift 3.0 and iOS 10. It's not as fun as the first time around (not even close), but I'm learning a ton. I'm trying to stick to MVMM and all the other "design patterns." Makes life a lot easier when you follow the rules. Keep up with my progress on <a href="https://github.com/WVU-Mobile/iOS">Github.</a></p>
